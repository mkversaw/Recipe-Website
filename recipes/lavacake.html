    <h3> Ingredients </h3>
    <ul>
        <li> 1/2 cup butter, cut into 8 pieces </li>
        <li> 6 and 1/2 squares semisweet chocolate, finely chopped</li>
        <li> 3 eggs </li>
        <li> 1/3 cup white sugar</li>
        <li> 4 tsp. unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li> 2 tbsp. all-purpose flour </li>
        <li> 1 pinch of salt </li>
    </ul>
    <h3> Steps </h3>
    <ol>
        
        <li>
            Preheat oven to 400 Fahrenheit. Grease and flour four 6-ounce ramekins.
        </li>

        <li>
            Place chocolate and butter in the top of a double boiler over simmering water.
            Stir frequently, scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching, until chocolate is melted, about 5 minutes.
        </li>

        <li>
            Combine eggs and sugar in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until pale and thick, about 5 minutes.
            Mix in melted chocolate, cocoa powder, and flour until combined. Pour batter into the prepared ramekins and place on a baking tray.
        </li>

        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until the sides are set but the middle is still jiggly, 10 to 13 minutes.
            Let cool for 5 minutes before serving.
        </li>

    </ol>
